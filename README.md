INTRODUCTION
------------

I wanted to afk on a game but wasn't able to find a good software to hold multiple keys and clicks at the same time,
so i created it only for fun. 
The program can be used to hold some keys or/and mouse click. In addition you can spam the keys at the speedrate you want and save the keys for your
next usage of the program. A guide if you have problems with the keyboard or mouse modules ( if you don't want to use the .exe file ) is accessible in
the program and in this file.

 * For a full description of the modules, visit the module page:

   * https://pypi.org/project/mouse
